## About
I am a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Rochester.  
My research lies at the intersection of international political economy and international security, examining how multinational corporations behave under geopolitical uncertainties, and how their interests shape international security and economic statecraft. Methodologically, I employ a range of approaches, including causal inference, text analysis, formal modelling, and qualitative historical analysis. I am also interested in American politics, especially on party politics and how interest groups influence economic policy agenda, both domestically and internationally.

I also have political-risk consulting experience with clients in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing guitar, listening to classical music, running, and playing golf (badly).
