## About
I am a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Rochester.  
My research lies at the intersection of International Political Economy and security, examining how multinational corporations behave under geopolitical uncertainties and shape international security and economic statecraft. Methodologically, I employ a range of approaches, including causal inference, text analysis, reinforcement learning, and qualitative historical analysis. I am also interested in American politics, especially on party politics and how interest groups influence economic policy agenda, both domestically and internationally.
